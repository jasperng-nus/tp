# InternBook User Guide

Welcome to InternBook!

InternBook is your go-to fast, reliable and customizable **desktop app for tracking internship details**

It is optimized for a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI), but you can still use the advantages of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI).


<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Started!

> **IMPORTANT**
> Ensure you have Java `11`  installed in your computer. If you do not have it installed, download it from [here.](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
1. Download the latest `internbook.jar` from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

2. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Internbook.

3. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar internbook.jar` command to run the application.
> **TIP**
> If you are struggling to figure out the path to `cd` into, you can use the File Explorer in your OS to copy the file path and directly `cd` to that.<br><br>


> Alternatively, you can simply navigate to the file location the File Explorer and double-click on the application to run.

  A GUI similar to the one displayed below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app already contains some sample data.<br><br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)<br><br>



4. Try out a command! <br>
   For instance, typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
 You can also try out the following commands:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add -n Company -e company@gmail.com -t Role`: Adds a company contact with name ``Company``, email ``company@gmail.com`` and tag ``Role``.

   * `delete 1` : Deletes the contact with index ``1``.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.<br><br>

5. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add -n COMPANY`, `COMPANY` is the input which can be used as `add -n DBS`.

* Fields in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `-n COMPANY [-p PHONE_NUMBER]` can be used as `-n DBS -p 61234567` or as `-n DBS`.

* Field with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `-t TAG…​` can be used as `-t Software Engineer`, `-t Software Engineer -t Data Analyst` etc.

* Fields can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n COMPANY -t Software Engineer`, `-t Software Engineer -n COMPANY` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in inputs (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, InternBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: How do I check if I am on JDK 11?<br>
**A**: For MAC users, open up your **Terminal**, and for Windows users, open up your **Command Prompt**.
Type in `java -version` and you will see the java version.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
